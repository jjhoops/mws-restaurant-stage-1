## Project - Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, the student will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. The student will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. The student will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Project Instructions:

The project utilizes MapBox to create maps for the restaurants.
It requires a MapBox key to be loaded in two locations:
1. main.js line 81
2. restaurant_info.js line 25
